          <h2>BACKGROUND</h2><br />
          <div class="content">
            <p>I am a software engineer in Boulder, CO. My background is in Electrical Engineering, and I received a Master of Engineering in EE from Cornell University in 2009. In high school and throughout most of college, I was an intern at <a href="http://datamininglab.com">Elder Research, Inc</a>, a data mining consulting firm in Charlottesville, VA. At Elder Research I worked on myriad data mining problems, using both off the shelf and custom built modelling software to find patterns in our customers' data sets. Notable projects included</p>
            <ul class="info">
              <li>The Netflix Prize. This was an open competition to improve the Netflix recommendation engine. Our team was one of the leading contenders, and our technique (multi-model ensebling) was the same as that used by the competition winner.</li>
              <li>Semantic Text Processor. I worked on a project to process large corpuses of text quickly, identifying key phrases (lemmatization) and detecting synonyms, using a modified version of locality sensitive hashing. The algorithm was language agnostic, meaning there was no built in understanding of the target language, such that it could be used on almost any body of text.</li>
              <li>Custom Data Mining Software. I authored three general purpose data mining tools: a <a href="http://datamininglab.com/products/143-nearest-neighbor">k-nearest neighbor</a> modeller, a custom <a href="http://datamininglab.com/products/142-texas-two-step">decision tree</a> algorithm, and a product <a href="http://datamininglab.com/products/140-quiltmaker">cross-selling</a> tool.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I spent the summer after my senior year working as an intern for <a href="http://www.relayfoods.com">Relay Foods</a> (called Retail Relay at the time). During this time, I adapted an off the shelf eCommerce package to meet the unique same-day pickup location business model that Relay employed. I also worked on a product cataloging application that ran on a Blackberry.</p>
            <p>After I graduated from my masters program, I worked for a year at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque. I worked on two primary projects - a synthetic aperture radar system and an FPGA based high speed signal processing application. At this time I was recruited back to Relay Foods as their first technology hire.</p>
            <p>For the first year, I was the only technology employee. I took over the development of the customer facing website and the admin portal from the CEO. I supported our operations and marketing teams with the reports and tools that they required. I also handled any devops and bugs that arose in any of our systems. We slowly grew the team and I managed the new members.</p>
            <p>After several years, I moved out of this role and became Vice President of Analytics. In this position I managed our data warehouse and ran various analyses for the company. Among these, I built a convolution based revenue model, ran a Monte Carlo analysis on the effect of first order fulfillment errors, and built a breakeven financial model to determine the sensitivity of our profitability on various metrics. I also acted as a technical resource for other analysts in the company.</p>
            <p>Although my title has not changed, I am now spending more time on special projects. These include assisting with migration from Quickbooks to a more mature accounting system, monitoring our spending by department, and evaluating options for a warehouse management system.</p>
